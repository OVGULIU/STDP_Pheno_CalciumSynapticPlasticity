## Sparsely connected spiking neuron network

Sparsely connected spiking neuron network from: Brunel, Dynamics of Sparsely Connected Networks of Excitatory and Inhibitory Spiking Neurons, Journal of Computational Neuroscience 2000, Volume 8, Issue 3, pp 183-208.

Comparing the Brunel model across implementations has started [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/Brunel2000/blob/master/NEST/README.md).
